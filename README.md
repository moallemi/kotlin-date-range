This is a tiny implementation of `rangeTo` operator for `LocalDate` that makes the syntax for loop iteration and control flow statements safe and natural to read.

## Installation

Add the kotlin-date-range to your dependencies section:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'me.moallemi.tools:kotlin-date-range:1.0.0'
}
```


## How to use

From Java SE 8 onwards, users are asked to migrate to java.time (JSR-310). For Android users, java.time is [added in API level 26+](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/time/package-summary). Projects needing to support lower API levels can use `java.util.Date`.

#### with `java.time.LocalDate`

Using `rangeTo` operator:

```kotlin
val startDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 3, 22)
val endDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 4, 1)
for (date in startDate..endDate) {
    println(date)
}
```

Usage with `step` function:

```kotlin
val startDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 3, 22)
val endDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 4, 1)
for (date in startDate..endDate step 2) {
    println(date)
}
```

Using with `in` operator:

```kotlin
val startDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1)
val endDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 5)

val result: Boolean = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 2) in (startDate..endDate)
```

#### with `java.util.Date`

Using `rangeTo` operator:

```kotlin
val calendar = Calendar.getInstance(Locale.getDefault())
calendar.set(2020, 0, 1)
val startDate = calendar.time
calendar.set(2020, 0, 5)
val endDate = calendar.time
for (date in startDate..endDate) {
    println(date)
}
```

Usage with `step` function:

```kotlin
for (date in startDate..endDate step 2) {
    println(date)
}
```
